            <p>Welcome to Page 2 of my website, this is the biography section! This is where you will you learn a bit more about me and my career as a journalism student and amateur photographer!</p>
              <h2>Journalism</h2>
            <p>I started my journalism career in 2017 and will be graduating hopefully in 2021. Throughout my degree I have learned about photojournalism, reporting, editing, coding and newspaper layout just to name a few. At the beginning of my journalism journey we were required to buy a DSLR camera, I bought mine from Best Buy Canada but there are many other great places to buy a DSLR. Below are a few suggestions listed if you are interested in buying one to take photos. </p>
              <ul><li><a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca" target="_blank">Best Buy Canada</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.henrys.com/" target="_blank">Henry's Canada</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.walmart.ca/en/electronics/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slr-cameras/N-1874" target="_blank">Walmart Canada</a></li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>Below is a photo I took with my DSLR camera recently during the pandemic. With a lot of down time due to quarantine, I thought I would refresh my memory on how to take quality DSLR photos.</p>

              </figure>
            <p>A lot of inspiration for my photos comes from the calming effect of nature. I enjoy shooting (a term photographers use when they are taking photos) flowers, trees (especially willow trees) and old houses like Victorian-style homes. In photojournalism you learn all about aperture, ISO and shutter speed. These terms may seem foreign to you so here are a few links to get you started on learning camera techniques.</p>

              <p>Journalism and photography go hand in hand for good storytelling. A great photo accompanying a credible news story that has been checked many times over is key in the field of journalism. There is so much to know about journalism, that I cannot put it all on this page. But if you yourself are curious about journalism, I would suggest reading about what goes on in a typical day of a journalist (there's a lot going on).</p>

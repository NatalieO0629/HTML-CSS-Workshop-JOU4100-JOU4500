            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>First off I want to give you guys a better picture of who I am. I am a Canadian journalism student and I enjoy photography, nature and dogs. All of these three elements about myself will be explored throughout the website. All of the photos on this website were either shot with my DSLR or my GoPro. Here below is an example.</p>

              <p>Secondly I am going to list off a few quick facts about myself and will do so in a Q and A format below.</p>
              <p>In this section, as mentioned above, I will make this interactive. Below I will write three statements about myself and you as the visitor will have to guess which ones are the truths and which one is the lie.</p> 
              <ul><li>I am above six feet tall</li>
                  <li>I taught myself how to knit during the pandemic quarantine</li>
                  <li>I have never been to Australia</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Answers to Q and A</h2>
              <p>Here are the answers to my fire round of two truths, one lie:</p>
              <ul><li>Truth: I am above six feet tall, I am actually six foot one and a half</li>
                  <li>Lie: I taught myself how to skateboard during the quarantine, not knit although I would be interested in knitting as well</li>
                  <li>Truth: I have never been to Australia but hope to go someday after my fear of flying is overcome for the long flight</li>
              </ul>
              <p>As you navigate throughout the rest of my website I hope you enjoy the photos and tidbits of information about me. Stick around long enough and you will see a very cute dog on the third page.</p>
